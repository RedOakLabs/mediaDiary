# Media Diary - Log

- Made a lot of progress in trying to switch from the old styled system to Material UI.
- The biggest hurtle was trying to make sure that the right scrolling is working correctly.

- I want to create a way of displaying the "month" row to be static and once it's static it would move as your start scrolling. BUT I also want this row to be virtualized, so it's not always loading the images.
- Maybe I need the images to be lazy loaded instead? Instead of just loading everything up front. Since the rows aren't really taking up that much data.

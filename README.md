# MediaDiary
A Keep track of _all_ your favorite media.

## Goals
- An extensible way of tracking your media by exposing an API and giving you tracking abilities.
- Here are some common ones that you can add if you subscribe yourself to an API
- I thought that it'd be great to add a user ability for free and limited by day. Rate limited in the intermin, but then for free if you provide your own API keys.
